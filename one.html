        <h1>EAFC - The Best Game in the World</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>EAFC is a revolution in football gaming, offering an immersive experience that combines stunning visuals, unparalleled realism, and an unmatched football atmosphere. EAFC’s gameplay is built on advanced physics, superior AI mechanics, and highly detailed player attributes.</p>
            <p>Whether you're a casual player or an esports competitor, EAFC’s blend of strategy, skill, and unpredictability mirrors real football like never before.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Physics & Realism</h2>
            <p>EAFC revolutionizes gameplay physics using its HyperMotion V engine. The improved ball trajectory system accurately calculates swerve, spin, and air resistance, resulting in lifelike passes, shots, and deflections. Players now plant their feet realistically, adding balance and physical duels that are reactive and believable.</p>
            <p>Dynamic weather conditions affect player behavior and pitch conditions. Rain slicks the ball surface, reducing control, while snowy pitches introduce unpredictable ball movement. These dynamic changes elevate immersion and strategy.</p>
            <p>From meticulously modeled grass textures to detailed stadium atmospheres, EAFC leverages volumetric lighting and shadow physics to create life-like matchday experiences. The game even introduces post-match player fatigue, impacting accuracy and performance in extended matches.</p>

            <h2>Player Overalls & Attributes</h2>
            <p>EAFC features a comprehensive player rating system based on real-life statistics and performance trends. Players are rated across multiple metrics such as pace, shooting, passing, dribbling, defending, and physicality. Star players are detailed with specific skill sets that reflect their real-life strengths and playing styles.</p>
            <p>For example, Lionel Messi’s tight control and precise dribbling make him ideal for intricate plays, while Erling Haaland’s strength and finishing abilities make him a top choice for target man tactics.</p>
            <p>Player attributes are dynamic, adjusting based on performance in career mode. A young talent’s growth may surge if consistently performing well, while aging players may experience slight stat regressions over time.</p>

            <h2>Player Mechanics</h2>
            <p>Dribbling mechanics have evolved in EAFC, with enhanced responsiveness in 1v1 duels. Players can now utilize realistic body feints, controlled bursts of pace, and precision touches to outmaneuver defenders. The new "Shield Control" system allows players to protect the ball intelligently using their body positioning.</p>
            <p>EAFC introduces enhanced finishing mechanics with improved volley controls, chip shot precision, and skill-based power shots that require timing mastery.</p>
            <p>Increased emphasis on off-the-ball movement empowers creative players. AI-controlled teammates now make smarter runs, diagonal movements, and space openings, mirroring top-level football strategies.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>AI Enhancements</h2>
            <p>EAFC’s improved AI introduces a strategic layer to matches. Opponent teams now utilize real-life tactics such as high presses, compact defensive lines, and targeted counter-attacks. Tactical adaptability means teams adjust formations based on in-game situations.</p>
            <p>AI-controlled players now prioritize positioning, with defenders covering passing lanes intelligently and attackers seeking creative angles for goal-scoring opportunities.</p>
            <p>Managers in career mode demonstrate distinct coaching identities. Teams like Manchester City may showcase possession-based tactics, while Atletico Madrid prioritize defensive structures and counter-attacks.</p>
